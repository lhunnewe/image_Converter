## Workflow Documentation Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good Practices We Follow:
- **Version Control**: Keep workflows in git
- **Clear Structure**: Logical step progression
- **Prerequisites**: Document setup requirements
- **Expected Outputs**: Show what success looks like
- **Error Handling**: Document common problems
- **Recovery Procedures**: Always provide rollback steps
- **Examples**: Show actual commands and outputs
- **Maintenance**: Keep documentation current

### üìù Workflow Maintenance
- Update workflows when scripts change
- Add new troubleshooting cases as they arise
- Get feedback from users and improve documentation
- Version control allows tracking changes

## Integration with Project

These workflows integrate with:
- **Scripts directory**: All commands reference actual scripts
- **Reports directory**: All outputs documented
- **Source code**: Workflows match actual implementation
- **Main README**: High-level documentation links here

## Future Workflow Ideas

Consider adding workflows for:
- **Development setup**: For contributors
- **Testing procedures**: For validation
- **Deployment steps**: For production use
- **Backup procedures**: For data safety
- **Migration workflows**: For upgrading

This approach to workflow documentation ensures users have the right level of detail for their needs while maintaining consistency and accuracy.
